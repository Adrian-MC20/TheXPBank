# Essentia

Essentia is a lightweight Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.10 that introduces a clean and intuitive system for storing and managing player XP.

The mod focuses on simplicity, clarity, and expandability. Version 1 adds the Essentia Vial, with future updates bringing the Essentia Bank block and a full XP management interface.

## What the Mod Does

Essentia allows players to:
- Store their XP safely in containers
- Carry XP between bases or worlds
- Save XP before dangerous encounters
- Share XP with teammates
- Use XP more strategically and efficiently

The goal is to replace the limitations of vanilla XP with a consistent, elegant, player-friendly XP ecosystem.

## Current Features

### **Essentia Vial**
A custom item that stores XP in precise units (XP points, not levels).

**Core behavior:**
- **Capacity:** 350 XP
- **Deposit:** Shift + Right-Click
- **Withdraw:** Right-Click (returns all stored XP)
- **Partial Fill:** Supported
- **Tooltip:** Shows exact XP stored
- **Dynamic Visual States:**
    - Empty
    - Partially filled
    - Full

The vial uses Minecraft’s modern data components and damage-based model dispatching to automatically update its appearance based on the fill level.

## Planned Features

### **Essentia Bank (Block)**
A stationary XP storage block with large capacity.
- Acts as a central XP reservoir
- Supports depositing/withdrawing XP
- Integrates naturally with Essentia Vials
- Ideal for mid/late-game storage setups

### **Custom GUI for the Essentia Bank**
A clean interface that will show:
- Current XP stored
- Transfer controls
- Vial slots
- Capacity indicators

### **User Experience Improvements**
- More refined tooltip indicators
- Optional HUD element for vial status

### **Audio & Animation**
- Sound effects when filling or withdrawing XP
- Light animation to make using the vial feel similar to drinking or channeling a potion

### **Stackable Empty Vials**
Empty Essentia Vials will be stackable (like vanilla glass bottles).  
When a player uses a stack:
- Only **one vial** separates from the stack
- That vial becomes the filled one
- The rest of the stack remains in the player’s hand

This keeps inventory management clean without breaking XP storage logic.

More items and features will be added in future updates as Essentia develops into a complete XP management system.
